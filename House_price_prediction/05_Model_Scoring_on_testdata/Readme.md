# Model Evaluation on Test Data

During the prediction phase on the test data, several challenges surfaced, necessitating extensive efforts to align the test data processing with the procedures applied to the training data. This involved replicating the data cleaning methods, addressing missing values using identical techniques, and, regrettably, resorting to manual adjustments.

In essence, the complexities encountered during the prediction process underscored the importance of establishing a streamlined and reproducible workflow. To overcome these challenges and enhance efficiency, the subsequent files will introduce a comprehensive machine learning pipeline. This pipeline aims to eliminate the need for manual interventions, ensuring a more robust and consistent approach across both training and test datasets.
