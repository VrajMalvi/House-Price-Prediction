# Feature Engineering with Open Source Libraries

This repository showcases the application of the same feature engineering steps used in [02_Data_preprocessing](https://github.com/VrajMalvi/ML_Pipeline_projects/tree/main/House_price_prediction/02_Data_preprocessing(feature%20Engineering)) but implemented with the assistance of open-source libraries.

While the current implementation successfully applies the required transformations, there is an opportunity to streamline the process further. By creating a dedicated class to encapsulate all the necessary steps, we can enhance reusability and efficiency. In the upcoming notebook, our aim is to significantly reduce the workload by establishing a comprehensive pipeline for seamless application of transformations on new data.
